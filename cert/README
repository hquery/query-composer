# Change into the query-gateway root directory.  Make a cert subdirectory.
cd $HOME/query-gateway && mkdir cert && cd cert
#
# Generate a self-signed certificate.  You need to answer some questions.
# Most of them can be answered arbitrarily but it is important that the
# Common Name be accurate.  For development and test purposes you can
# use something like *.localdomain to cover all hosts in localdomain.
# I used:
# Country Name (2 letter code) [GB]:CA
# State or Province Name (full name): British Columbia 
# Locality Name (eg, city): Victoria
# Organization Name (eg, company): University of Victoria 
# Organizational Unit Name (eg, section): Island Medical Program
# Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname): *.localdomain
# Email Address: scoophealth@googlegroups.com
#
# This will generate the certificate and key in a file named server.pem:
openssl req -new -x509 -keyout server.pem -out server.pem -nodes -days 365
#
# Copy the self-signed certificate to query-gateway/cert/ca
# [The location and name can be changed but must match
# the entries in query-gateway/script/secure_rails.]
mkdir ca && cp server.pem ca/LeadLab_root_cert_TEST.pem && rm server.pem
#
# Note: We used *.localdomain for the "Common Name" when prompted
# for that information.  For this to work, you will need an /etc/hosts
# file that maps IP addresses to entries in the localdomain.  For instance,
# $ cat /etc/hosts
# 127.0.0.1	localhost localhost.localdomain
# 127.0.1.1	query-composer query-composer.localdomain
# 192.168.52.100 mysql-host mysql-host.localdomain
# 192.168.52.101 query-gateway0 query-gateway0.localdomain
# 192.168.52.102 query-composer query-composer.localdomain
# 192.168.52.103 query-gateway1 query-gateway1.localdomain
#
# Now find the hash of the self-signed certificate
# $ openssl x509 -hash -noout -in ../cert/ca/LeadLab_root_cert_TEST.pem
#
# 962a3564
#
# Create a symbolic link from the self-signed certicate to a file in
# /etc/ssl/certs with name matching the hash with suffix '.0'.
#
# /etc/ssl/certs/962a3564.0 ->/home/vagrant/query-gateway/cert/ca/LeadLab_root_cert_TEST.pem 
#
# For this particular self-signed certificate's hash, I did this:
# $ sudo ln -s /home/vagrant/query-gateway/cert/ca/LeadLab_root_cert_TEST.pem /etc/ssl/certs/962a3564.0
#
# To start up the SSL secured version of query-gateway on port 3002 use:
# $ bundle exec script/delayed_job start
# $ bundle exec rails server -p 3002
